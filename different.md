title: Why We're Different
---
Tully here. What sets us apart is a deep understanding of both sides of the workshop context: a lifetime of performing, and years of growing a startup business from the ground.

As an improviser and facilitator, I know what works for audiences. As a manager, I know what my team needs. (It's probably not so different from what any team needs.) That dual-contextual understanding remains rare in the universe of workshop offerings.

**Performance:**

I started improvising in 2013, and have trained and performed at the top improv theaters in Chicago: Second City, iO, CIC, and more. I have been performing for my whole life, and have studied and worked in clown, puppetry, experimental and devised theater, music, and more. (We could back to high school speech & debate, too, but there's no need to relive that here.)

As an improv teacher and artistic facilitator, I have taught student and corporate audiences all over the world -- from southeastern Alaska to southern Africa.

**Business:**

I spent five years working at a tech startup based in New York: initially launching operations in our second marketplace, then wearing multiple hats, and ultimately leading teams doing procurement, launch, and service design. During my tenure, we grew from fewer than 50 people to nearly 1,000.
