title: Why We're Different
---
What sets us apart is a deep understanding of both sides of the workshop context: a lifetime of performing, and years of growing a business from the ground.

As an improviser and facilitator, I know what works for audiences. As a manager, I know what my team needs, what any team fundamentally needs. Understanding both sides of the room remains rare in the universe of workshop offerings.

I started improvising in 2013, and have trained and performed at the top improv theaters in Chicago: Second City, iO, CIC, and more. I have been performing for my whole life, across many forms: clown, puppetry, experimental theater, music, and more. (We could back to high school speech & debate, too, but maybe that's for another time.)

As an improv teacher and artistic facilitator, I have taught student and corporate audiences all over the world -- from southeastern Alaska to southern Africa.

I spent five years working at a tech startup based in New York: initially launching operations in our second marketplace, then wearing multiple hats, and ultimately leading teams running procurement, launch, and service design. During my tenure, the company grew from fewer than 50 employees to nearly 1,000.
