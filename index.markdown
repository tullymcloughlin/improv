Now more than ever, we need a fresh reminder of how to be together. The ability to trust in one another is our birthright, but this bright quality is easily clouded over by the standard ways in which we come to relate to one another.

We forget how to return to this place of openness. Even when we see each other in person, this is true. When we are separated by circumstances, forced to work virtually, to interact mostly or only through digital media, it becomes that much more challenging to remain collaborative, to give the benefit of the doubt, to arrive with attention and presence.

The consequences of mistrust and miscommunication are great. In personal relationships, in teams, in organizations big and small. As individuals and as a collective it is becoming ever more critical to show up as best selves as often as we can.

Play is a sort of magic elixir that summons up our best qualities: listening, joy, attention, creativity, inclusivity. When we re-learn how to play, these qualities emerge naturally. When we work on sharpening up these qualities, it becomes easier and more fun to play.
