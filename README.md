## About Me

I started improvising in 2015, and have trained and performed at the top theaters in Chicago: Second City, iO, CIC, and more.

I have taught student and corporate improv workshops all over the country. I have been an artistic facilitator all over the world -- from Southeastern Alaska to Southern Africa.

I've also spent years working in the startup world, and I understand the team challenges that come with fast growth, market uncertainty, major product pivots.


## Why Improv

At its best, improv is the height of co-creation. It's really hard to do well, because for it to be good, the performers must deeply and implicitly trust one another. Only with trust will each performer be willing to take a risk.

No wonder the tools and techniques of improv can be used to establish more effective communication between members of any team.

We're always improvising, making things up as we go along, but we get caught in the stories that we tell ourselves about one another. We stop listening, and we stop trusting.

On stage, this means a bad show. Off stage, this means division and dissatisfaction in place of understanding, co-creativity, and innovation.

Improv can give us a way back to a more open and fun way of being with one another, where there is space for whatever is happening, where there is the possibility of making gold from any "mistake," moment after moment.

Now more than ever, we need a reminder of how to be together, in person or in our virtual spaces. Improv can be a big part of that reminder.
